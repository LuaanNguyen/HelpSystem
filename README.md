## Generic Guidelines for Project Evaluations
The instructor will evaluate the groups periodically, phase by phase, based on the submitted written documents of each group. It is important that groups must hand in their project documents on time, and no late submissions will be accepted. The confidential self-evaluation of students for other group members will be considered for differentiating the grades of group members. Each group member is expected to contribute equally to the project, and group members not making contributions to the project will receive zero for the project grade.

## Project Grading Criteria
- **Timeliness (and quality) of documents**: Groups must turn in their project documents on time (early is better).
- **Quality and completeness of the Software System Design**
- **Thoroughness, completeness, and organization of Testing**
- **Software System Operation**: Lack of errors, system crashes, ease of use, readability of user manual, correctness, and completeness of user manual, etc.
- **Quality of Presentation**: Organization, pertinence, clarity, and understandability of oral presentation, preparation, use of visual aids, and the effectiveness of demonstration, etc.
- **Quality, completeness, and organization of the Final Report**: Projects with significant contributions and publishable quality may be submitted to appropriate conferences so that you will get a chance to present your work to peers.
